# Rock Paper Scissors

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of rock paper scissors using react. It has a clean and simple UI. It allows you to play a simple game against a computer without added complexity. Don't worry the computer doesn't know what you're throwing when it throws it's move. You can pick how many rounds you want to play. After each round, you'll see who won. Your throw will be on the left, the computer's throw will be on the right, and an evaluator will be in the middle. You have to move fast, because if you take too long, the round will be forfeited to the computer. But don't worry the timer is there for you to see. Who ever wins each round gets a point. Whenever one player has enough points that they're guaranteed a victory, the game is over. The score is displayed before your choices of rock, paper, or scissors. You can either click the icons or click 1, 2, or 3 on your keyboard to choose rock, paper, or scissors respectively. This game works on phone, tablet, and desktop so play anywhere you'd like.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
